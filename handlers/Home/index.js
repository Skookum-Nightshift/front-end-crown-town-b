            <p>You may store your compostable items in our complimentary odor-sealed four gallon bucket. On your scheduled trash collection day leave your bucket outside to be emptied, cleaned and left near your front door. Meanwhile, professional composters turn your food waste into nutrient-rich soils that you can use to grow food in your personal or community garden.</p>
